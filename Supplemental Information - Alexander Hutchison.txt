Alexander Hutchison

(a) How long did you spend on each part of this assignment?
	About 7 hours, did not keep exact count.
(b) Was the assignment difficult for you? Why or why not?
	Not really, Great Leadership made this project far easier and faster then a solo project.
(c) Did you enjoy working as a group to solve this problem? Why or why not? 
	Yes, It gave me experience working in a group with subversion control instead of
	passing the file back and forth that ive had to do up until now.
